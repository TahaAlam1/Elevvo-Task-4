💰 Loan Approval Prediction

📌 Elevvo Internship – Task 04

🔍 Project Overview

Built a classification model to predict loan approvals using Logistic Regression and Decision Tree algorithms. Addressed class imbalance using SMOTE to improve model fairness and recall.

⚙️ Key Highlights

Trained models with and without SMOTE to observe the impact on performance

SMOTE improved recall and led to more balanced predictions

Showcased the importance of data preprocessing for fair model outcomes

🛠 Technologies Used

Python

scikit-learn

imbalanced-learn (SMOTE)

Pandas & NumPy

Matplotlib & Seaborn

📈 Takeaways

Handling class imbalance is critical for real-world fairness

SMOTE effectively boosts performance on minority class

Preprocessing directly impacts model accuracy and fairness
